This repository documents our in-depth rural survey on the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) conducted in Soraon, Prayagraj. Our study aimed to evaluate the awareness, accessibility, and impact of RKSK programs on adolescent health, focusing on key areas such as nutrition, mental health, reproductive health, substance misuse, and violence prevention.

Methodology:
Survey Design: Structured questionnaires with multiple-choice, open-ended, and Likert-scale questions.

Sampling: Cluster sampling targeting adolescents (10–19 years), parents, teachers, and health workers.

Data Collection: Face-to-face interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), and field observations.

Data Analysis: Performed cross-tabulations and chi-square tests using SPSS to derive meaningful insights.

Ethical Considerations: Ensured privacy, obtained informed consent, and maintained confidentiality.

Key Findings:
✔ Low awareness of RKSK programs among rural communities.
✔ Mental health and substance abuse concerns remain largely unaddressed.
✔ Structural and digital gaps hinder access to healthcare services.
✔ Community members show strong willingness to engage in behavior change initiatives.

Recommendations:
✅ Strengthen the Peer Educator Program for better outreach.
✅ Enhance digital awareness campaigns through social media and radio.
✅ Improve accessibility via mobile health units in remote regions.
✅ Integrate RKSK with the School Health and Wellness Program for holistic adolescent care.

This research highlights the urgent need for policy interventions, better resource allocation, and community engagement to enhance adolescent health programs. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to contribute to a more effective and inclusive implementation of RKSK in rural India.
